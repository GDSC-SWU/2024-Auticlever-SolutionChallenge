## 📢 Project Introduction
High-functioning autism falls into the normal category in official language evaluation, but it actually has difficulty communicating one's intentions to others or understanding others' intentions.

We developed Auticlever, a speech recording app for correct parent-led intervention, to help improve communication skills of high-function autistic children through parent-led intervention.

Auticlever is an Android app for parents raising autistic children that helps artificial intelligence automatically convert conversations with autistic children every day into text, summarizing the core content, and making it easy to understand how they talk to them. 

In addition, 10 recommended themes are provided every day to help parents find various conversation topics easily, and the recording function for recording at hospitals and counseling centers converts voice into text, AI simplifies the content, helping parents raise their children efficiently.


With these features, our app has the potential to help children with autism and their parents.

## 📌 Our Goal

Society's view of individuals on the autism spectrum is cold. Autism is characterized by a lack of understanding of relationships, communication, and social subtleties (irony and sarcasm). 
Therefore, Auticlever provides communication training and documentation services to help autistic children adapt to society and become independent.

This allows individuals with autism to lead healthy and stable lives without being alienated from society.
